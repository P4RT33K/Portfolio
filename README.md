# Hi guys! I made my personal portfolio website.         (2021 - current)

## [This is my personal portfolio website](https://parteek-portfolio.netlify.app/homepage), that I've coded in the Atom desktop application, now on VS Code. I made this website using HTML5, CSS3 & JS and is currently hosted on Netlify.

### The main sections are:
- About Me - In this section, I've put a small description about me, along with all the social media handles I use. The main area is then divided into three different parts, skills, experience & education. There is also an option to download my resume.
- Services - This section gives a small brief about what services I would like to and can provide.
- Projects - As the name suggests, this section has all my projects listed, along with their thumbnails, information and link. There are not many projects listed, as I'm still working on a lot of things.
- Contact Me - Here, I have listed all the basic contact information along with a form to contact me easily.

### The main features, that I would like to highlight are:
- Option to turn on and off the 'Dark Mode'.
- Option to change the main theme colours. Pink is the main starting theme colour.
- Animations on the loading page, as well as, on the main homepage.

### Problems that I faced:
- The main problem was time management. I didn't work on the website for like 3 months, mainly because I had shifted countries at that time, from India to Canada in September. So, it was a time, I had to face a lot of shifts in living conditions. Life has been quite rough, but that talk is for another time.
- Another problem was my anxiety, as I would sometimes give up working on it in between as I felt that I was not capable to do it. But, slowly, I pushed through it and made it this far.

Thank you for all your support and for listening to me this far.

Please do look into my portfolio and do give feedback. I would really appreciate it.
